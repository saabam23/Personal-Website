  <p class="abt"><strong class="abt-strong">Sydney Abam</strong> Hello! My name is Sydney and I am currently a first-year at the University of Michigan Ann-Arbor. I love to write, spend time with my friends, and go on adventures with my family. After taking an introduction to coding class in eighth grade, my passion for computer science grew. Since I loved the concept of storytelling, I was able to combine that skill with my projects. I started learning about website development in tenth grade during my participation in the Girls Who Code Summer Program. However, after high school, I hope to continue my college education in the areas of software engineering, economics, artificial intelligence, and social sciences. </p>
