    <p class="date"><strong>(July 2021 - April 2022)</strong></p>
  </div>
  <p class="web-des">The E.R. is an activist toolkit website that I coded in the Girls Who Code Summer Program. Ever since the mass protests in 2020, I wanted to create a platform to help users become aware of the racial injustice all over the world.

    <p class="date"><strong>(July 2022 - Present)</strong></p>
  </div>
  <p class="web-des">The B.I.B Project is a web musuem of African and Black culture. This was initially created as a photo gallery which showcased the beauty of black people. However, it is currently under construction to become a resource to learn about African American history. (Viewed better on a PC or laptop) <strong> Programming Languages: HTML, CSS</strong></p>

  </div>
  <p class="web-des">Keeping Up With Klimate Change is another activist toolkit that I made along with two people in the Kode With Klossy Summer Program. I had very little knowledge about climate change so this was a chance to do deep research on the realities of this environmental issue.

    <p class="date"><strong>(November 2022 - Present)</strong></p>
  </div>
  <p class="web-des">Plug is a student led organization that I founded in 2021 for my Girl Scout Gold Award Project. The website acts as an activist toolkit for users and spreads awareness on mental health. The purpose of this project is to address the stigma, educate teens on life skills to improve their well-being, build various communities of people who share the same interests, and provide reliable education on topics that affect teens' mental health. This is one of my favorite website projects so far and I am excited to continue it. (Viewed better on a PC or laptop)<strong> Programming Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery</strong></p>

  </div>
  <p class="web-des">This is my official portfolio website which I hope to publish as I begin work as a freelance web developer. Usually, I like to make my projects extravagant with a lot of colors and graphics but I wanted to see how I can work with simplicity while still making my website attractive. Also, this is the first website that is responsive to mobile devices and computer desktops! <strong>Programming Languages: HTML, CSS</strong></p>

  <p class="web-des">This website was a random Web Dev project that I thought would be a cool concept. I am using this project to practice implementing simple, eye-catching text fonts and consistent background colors. Through this website, I hope to learn about branding strategy and proper design techniques. (Viewed better on a PC or laptop) <strong>Programming Languages: HTML, CSS</strong></p>
